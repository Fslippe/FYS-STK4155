# Project 2

This Project includes 3 Folders
- figures:  Figures used in report and generated using the included python files
- latex:    Report Pdf, .tex and project description 
- src:      All python code used in this project 

Following packages need to be installed before running the code:
- pip3 install matplotlib
- pip3 install numpy 
- pip3 install sklearn
- pip3 install seaborn

The code is structured around two classes, one functions file including most used functions, one grid search file including grid search functions, and 3 files used to analyze 3 different datasets.
- NN.py: Feed forward Neural Network class
- gradient_descent.py: gradient descent class (GD or SGD)
- functions.py: Includes functions used in most of other python files
- grid_search.py: Includes grid search functions used when analyzing data
- 1D_compare.py: Analysis of a 1-dimensional function using the gradient descent class, OLS and Ridge.
- franke_compare.py: Analysis of the franke function using the NN class, OLS and Ridge 
- breast_Cancer.py: Analysis of breast cancer data using logistic function with the gradient descent class and the neural network class.

To reproduce the results run the python files with
- python3 filename.py
