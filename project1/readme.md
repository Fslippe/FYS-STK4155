# Project 1

This Project includes 4 Folders
- data:     Here can the imported data be found
- figures:  Figures used in report and found using the included python files
- latex:    Report Pdf, .tex and project description 
- src:      All python code used in this project 

Following packages need to be installed before running the code:
- pip3 install matplotlib
- pip3 install numpy 
- pip3 install sklearn
- pip3 install imageio

The code is structured with pythonfiles with names b.py, c.py... corresponding to the tasks described in "Project_description.pdf" found in the latex folder. There is also a main functions.py which contains general functions used in most of the other files. 

To reproduce the results run the python files with
- python3 file.py  
For running g.py the data file located in the data folder needs to be downloaded. The rest should work if all the python files are located in the same folder.
