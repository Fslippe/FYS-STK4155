# Project 3 - Predicting rainfall tomorrow based on todayâ€™s weather using machine learning methods.

This Project includes 4 Folders
- code:      All python code used in this project 
- extra:    Code and pdf for extra task. See folder README for more information
- figures:  Figures used in report and generated using the included python files
- latex:    Report Pdf, .tex and project description 

Following packages need to be installed before running the commands:
```
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install numpy 
pip3 install sklearn
pip3 install seaborn
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install keras
pip3 install tensorflow_decision_forests
pip3 install pandas
```
The code is structured around one main function which imports general functions from functions.py and a gradient decent class from gradient_decent.py

To reproduce the results run the main file with
- python3 main.py
